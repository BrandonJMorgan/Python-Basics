So About me I am currently 20 years old I am fully self taught I do not code for money obviously 
because im not getting paid for this. I simply enjoy this but with that being said I have been paid
to do a few websites for small buisnesses and I hope to be employed someday using python and Javascript. 
Until then I will continue to learn and you can view my code on here
